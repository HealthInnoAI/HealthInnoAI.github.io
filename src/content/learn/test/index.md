# What is HIV?
**Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)**

A sexually transmitted virus that destroys white blood cells in the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to life-threatening diseases

:::important[Did you know?]
* Over 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS.
* Globally, half of infections are among women, but in the U.S., HIV is predominantly among men who share needles or have sex with men.
* HIV remains a major global health issue, with an estimated 42.3 million deaths and ongoing transmission worldwide.

| ‚Ä¢ The immune system produces white blood cells (leukocytes) to kill pathogens. | ‚Ä¢ HIV attaches to special immune cells called CD4 cells and uses them to make copies of itself.|
|‚Ä¢ Leukocytes recognize pathogens by surface antigens, where antibodies attach. | ‚Ä¢ It destroys these CD4 cells over time, making the immune system weaker. |
|‚Ä¢ Inflammation expands blood flow, bringing more leukocytes to the area. | ‚Ä¢ When too many CD4 cells are lost (below 200 cells per millimeter of blood), the body becomes very vulnerable to infections. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Progression of HIV**

HIV spreads through certain body fluids: blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk.
* Mild flu-like symptoms can appear soon after infection.
* Many people stay symptom-free for years, while others develop symptoms earlier.

**Transmission of HIV**
* Exposure (except breast milk) can happen through:
* Vaginal, anal, or oral-genital sex
* Sharing needles or needle injuries
* Blood transfusions or organ transplants
* Artificial insemination
* Childbirth


:::warning[Risk Factors]
* Number of sexual contacts with an infected partner
* Type of sexual activity
* Amount of virus in body fluids
* Other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
* Circumcision status
* Genetics

| **HIV is NOT Transmitted by ‚ùå**                                                                 | **How HIV is Diagnosed ü©∫**                                                  | **HIV Treatment üíä**                                                                       |

| ‚Ä¢ Donating blood: Always safe, sterile needles are used.                                      | ‚Ä¢ HIV is diagnosed by detecting antibodies.                               | ‚Ä¢ HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) uses a combination of antiviral drugs.    |
| ‚Ä¢ Casual contact: No risk from hugs, handshakes, or sharing bathrooms.                        | ‚Ä¢ ELISA: Common test using blood, saliva, or urine.                       | ‚Ä¢ Reduced U.S. HIV death rate by 75% since the 1990s.                                    |
| ‚Ä¢ Insect or animal bites: HIV cannot survive in animals.                                      | ‚Ä¢ OraQuick: Faster antibody test, sometimes for home use.                | ‚Ä¢ Treatment is expensive.                                                                |
| ‚Ä¢ Airborne germs or food: HIV does not spread like colds or food poisoning.                   | ‚Ä¢ Antibodies take weeks to appear (window period).                       | ‚Ä¢ Global access to these advances remains limited.                                       |
| ‚Ä¢ Sharing spaces: No risk from living or working with someone who has HIV.                    | ‚Ä¢ Positive results require confirmation.                                 |                                                                                          |
| ‚Ä¢ Kissing: Closed mouth: No risk.                                                             |                                                                           |                                                                                          |

# **Signs and symptoms**
The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection.

:::caution
HIV spreads more easily in the first few months after a person is infected, but many are unaware of their status until the later stages

### Facts about ART (Treatment):

-	People living with HIV who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and have an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. 
-	Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission.
-	Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but allows a person‚Äôs immune system to get stronger. This helps them to fight other infections.
-	Currently, ART must be taken every day for the rest of a person‚Äôs life. ART lowers the amount of the virus in a person‚Äôs body. This stops symptoms and allows people to live full and healthy lives.
