# Welcome to HealthInno!

We are building an AI-powered, gamified health platform designed specifically for Latine youth.  
Our mission is to create a safe, relatable, and empowering space where young people can ask real health questions, get accurate, fact-checked AI answers, and earn rewards for learning.

Stay tuned for updates on our progress as we develop features like:
- Myth-busting AI conversations
- Gamified achievements (points, badges, leaderboards)
- Culturally relevant health education
- Daily streak challenges to keep users engaged

We believe that technology, empathy, and trust can transform health equity for Latine youth.  
Thank you for being part of this journey with us!
